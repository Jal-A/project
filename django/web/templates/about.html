<p><b>I followed my heart.
Life is short and everyone has something that they are passionate about. Be able to say that you didn't let fear hold you back. The cost of not following your heart is spending the rest of your life wishing you had.</p></b>

<p><b> I speak up.
When you don't speak up for the things that matter to you, you are not being true to yourself. When you speak your mind, you stand with confidence and gain courage.</p></b>
<p><b>The positive spin of life’s surprises.
You are never at the total mercy of life’s surprises.  No matter what life throws at you, you can decide what these events mean to you in the short term, the long term, and how you will integrate them into your life.</p></b>
